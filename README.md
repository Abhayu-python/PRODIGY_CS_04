# PRODIGY_CS_04
# 🚀Overview:
Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering pixel values within an image to obscure its content, rendering it unreadable without a decryption key.

# 🧐Why pixel manipulation?
Security: Changes to pixel values can render the image unrecognizable, protecting its content. 

Efficiency: Pixel manipulation can be implemented relatively quickly, enabling faster encryption and decryption. 

Versatility: Can be adapted to various encryption algorithms and image formats. 

# 🛠️Language used:
Python language is used to build this task.
